        <p> My first week of school was very good. It was exciting to see all my friends again. 
            There were also a lot of new teachers so it was nice to see new people. It was also fun to 
            restart clubs.

        <p> The work became more challenging but I learnt it. It was also good to be able tohang out with
            all of my friends. It was also very nice to meet some of the new year 7 and I recognised some 
            of them from my primary school.
